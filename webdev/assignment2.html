    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) </strong>refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, and language understanding. AI systems use algorithms, data, and computational power to mimic or replicate various aspects of human intelligence.</p>
    
    <h3>There are two primary types of AI:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is designed for a specific task or a narrow set of tasks. It excels in performing these tasks but lacks the general intelligence and adaptability of human beings. Examples include virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as image and speech recognition software.</li>
        <br> 

        <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) (or Strong AI): AGI represents a level of AI that possesses human-like intelligence and can understand, learn, and adapt to a wide range of tasks and contexts, similar to the flexibility and generalization abilities of humans. AGI remains a goal for future AI development and has not been achieved as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.</li>

            <td>    Automation: AI can perform repetitive tasks with high accuracy and efficiency, reducing the need for human intervention in tasks such as data analysis, customer support, and manufacturing, which can lead to cost savings and increased productivity.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Decision Support: AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data to provide valuable insights and recommendations, helping businesses and individuals make more informed decisions.</td>
            <td>Bias and Fairness: AI algorithms can inherit biases from their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, especially in areas like hiring or lending decisions.</td>

            <td class="last_tr">Personalization: AI can customize experiences, such as content recommendations on streaming platforms or targeted advertising, improving user satisfaction and engagement.</td>
